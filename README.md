# Java in Two Semesters: Featuring JavaFX

Source code for programs from [the textbook *Java in Two Semesters Featuring JavaFX* by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319994192). The text is divided into two parts. Each part supports a one-semester module, the first part addressing fundamental programming concepts, and the second part building on this foundation, teaching the skills required to develop more advanced applications.

Fourth edition covers the developments introduced in Java 8, including JavaFX, lambda expressions and the Stream API. <img sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="cover.jpg"/>
